"""Add working routines from mat inverse v8 and create class around them"""



#add the full working routines here and create a class, then,
#create another file that imports the class and uses them to perform the validation tests and timing tests


#For benchmarking, should probably create a class that uses the benchmark code or maybe just a function for now
#that is in its own folder called tests or something. The file name can be something like benchmark.py... We can expand
#upon this later...
