~good copy-ish rough work and notebooks can go here

This folder contains rough notebooks that act as sets of notes with more or less full explainations of underlying 
math behind main routines, along with simulations & validation tests. 

Note that especially so, this folder is more designed for work that has already been through a significant amount of 
debugging and testing in another more-or-less designated folder; this folder is more like a 'good copy' place for rough
work, if that even makes sense....
