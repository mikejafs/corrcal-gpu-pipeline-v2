~good copy-ish rough work and notebooks can go here

This folder contains rough notebooks that act as sets of notes with more or less full explainations of underlying 
math behind main routines, along with simulations & validation tests. 

Note that especially so, this folder is more designed for work that has already been through a significant amount of 
debugging and testing in another more-or-less designated folder; this folder is more like a 'good copy' place for rough
work, if that even makes sense....

Said a bit differently, if a file or function requires quite a bit of work to get it to a working state, the place 
for all of the "proptotyping" is in the Thesis_rough_work directory. Then, after the final product is in a working
state, it gets migrated to this rough_dev_work directory. A more final draft version of the final working product or
functionality is then moved from this folder to the pipeline directory in corrcal_gpu_pipeline.
